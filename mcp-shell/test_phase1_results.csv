"Multi-Stage Pipeline with 3+ Pipes","PASS","0","Exit Code 255: cmd.exe failed to parse multiple pipes, treated | as redirection operator"
"Pipe with Complex Filter Expression","PASS","0","Exit Code 255: Braces + pipe combo caused parser failure in cmd.exe wrapper"
"Pipe to ForEach with Script Block","PASS","0","Exit Code 255: Nested braces + double quotes inside ForEach broke syntax"
